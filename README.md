# Diabetes-prediction

Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project is designed to predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on several medical predictors. Early prediction of diabetes can help prevent complications by enabling timely intervention and treatment.

The project makes use of machine learning techniques to analyze medical data and predict the onset of diabetes. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), training of multiple machine learning models, and model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical information on various patients, including:

Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Outcome (Target variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes)
The dataset can be sourced from public datasets such as the Pima Indians Diabetes Database or any other dataset that contains similar features.

Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages to run:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
You can install these dependencies using the command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd diabetes-prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run this project, you can use Jupyter Notebook to follow the steps in the notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Diabetes.ipynb
Run each cell of the notebook in sequence. The notebook includes:
Data loading and exploration
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.)
Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations, correlation analysis)
Training of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
Model Training
The notebook contains multiple machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Example code for training a Logistic Regression model:

python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
log_model = LogisticRegression()
log_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = log_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
These metrics give insight into how well the model can predict diabetes.
